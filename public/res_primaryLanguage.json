    "description": "I'm Matt Rangel. Former project manager for a large electrical construction company, and now a Software Developer. I have worked my way from being a laborer to a project manager in a decades time. In each role, I have been entrusted to guide teams and have worked successfully alongside some excellent people. I’m looking for that same environment within the tech field, so I can learn new skills and collaborate in solving problems. Software Development reminds me when I started in the construction field, where I knew nothing. I had to lean heavily on my peers and the more I learned, the more I realize I didn’t know. So I keep an open mind, keeping driving and learning new concepts that excite me and find ways on how I can apply my new found skill to solve real world problems. I realize I’m cracking my creative side open and see whole new set of possibilities. I would love to be more involved in helping solve the worlds problems, through the power of coding!",
